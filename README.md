Go to Kaggle Titanic Dataset and download the train.csv file.

Step 2: Load and Explore the Data

Step 3: Data Cleaning
Handle missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns.
Convert categorical variables into numerical format.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Survival Rate by Gender
2. Age Distribution
3.  Survival Rate by Passenger Class

Step 5: Correlation Analysis
Check how different features relate to survival.

Next Steps
Feature engineering: Create new variables, e.g., FamilySize (SibSp + Parch).
Build predictive models using Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
